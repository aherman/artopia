This photo accidentally got posted upside-down, which inspired an interesting thought. Anyone who's ever "puffed" a dandelion knows how delicate and fragile they are. However they are also firmly attached to the ground through their roots. In fact they are more firmly attached to the Earth than we humans are. As the orientation of this photo reminds us, without gravity we would float away (up/down/sideways depending on your orientation). While their seeds are barely attached to the Earth, the Dandelion has strong attached roots.
