text: Strategy provides structure to our efforts. It describes how we handle the use of available resources (like materials, energy, time, and knowledge) and how we respond to new information or obstacles. Our strategies may be steeped in tradition. They may be simple or complex. They may be consciously or unconsciously undertaken.
