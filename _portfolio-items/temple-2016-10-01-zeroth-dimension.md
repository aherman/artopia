title: The Zeroth Dimension
author:
date: 2016-10-01
text: The zeroth dimension is the one true dimension. All other dimensions are constructs, systems and illusions contained within it. Existence is topological, following the properties of continuity, connectedness, and convergence. It expands as a fractal in to singularity and out to infinity. It is the cosmic portal to spirituality. It represents both Truth and interpretation. Thus it cannot be expressed or shared directly, but must be experienced individually through mindfulness and love.
