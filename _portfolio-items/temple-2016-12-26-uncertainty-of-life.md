It is impossible to know what our actions will lead to, how our relationships will turn out, what our impact will be.

The most we can ask for and expect from life is to reflect and ask, _"Did I treat others with love and compassion? Did I take advantage of every opportunity to grow? Did I stay present - truly living in the moment with appreciation and love? Did I pursue my passions?"_

This is how to live without fear or regret.
