title: Pink Floyd Meddle - Full-Length Animation
author:
date: 2015-07-29
text: What I envision is an entirely animated video that seamlessly ties in every track to tell a story of heartbreak, perseverance, love, and growth. Included is concept art I drew and a description of the story for each song (along with links to the song tracks).
