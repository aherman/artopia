text: I invite and challenge you to disrupt these modern comforts. Suspend your disbelief and urges for just one month. Resist the temptation to fill boredom with other people's lives and opinions. Whether you think mass media is an incarnation of evil or a platform for cultural renaissance, I invite and challenge you to just turn it off and see what happens.
