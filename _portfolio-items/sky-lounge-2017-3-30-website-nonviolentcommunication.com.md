"Nonviolent Communication is the integration of 4 things:

* Consciousness: a set of principles that support living a life of empathy, care, courage, and authenticity
* Language: understanding how words contribute to connection or distance
* Communication: knowing how to ask for what we want, how to hear others even in disagreement, and how to move toward solutions that work for all
* Means of influence: sharing 'power with others' rather than using 'power over others'"
