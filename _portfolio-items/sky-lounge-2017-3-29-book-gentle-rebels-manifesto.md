"The Impact of Personal Sensitivity in an Insensitive World...

Introverts and highly sensitive people.

We need time and space to explore and enjoy our
deep thoughts.

We celebrate and enjoy differences between us; we
don’t use them to score points, develop divisions, and
perpetuate hatred.

We don’t blindly accept the status quo simply
because ‘it’s how we’ve always done it’…
We want to know why."
