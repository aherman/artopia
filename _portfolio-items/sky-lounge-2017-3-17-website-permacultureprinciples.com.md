text: "'Permaculture is a creative design process based on whole-systems thinking informed by ethics and design principles. This approach guides us to mimic the patterns and relationships we can find in nature and can be applied to all aspects of human habitation, from agriculture to ecological building, from appropriate technology to education and even economics.'"
