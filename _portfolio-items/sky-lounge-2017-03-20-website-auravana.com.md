text: "'The Auravana Project exists to co-create the emergence of community through the openly shared design, construction, and operation of a socio-economically unified network of integrated city systems in which purposefully driven individuals are fulfilled in their development toward a higher potential state of human experience for themselves and all others. We are developing a highly automated, moneyless society oriented toward human fulfillment and ecological sustainability.'"
