title: On the Turning Away
author: Pink Floyd
date: 2017-03-21
text: "'No more turning away. From the weak and the weary. No more turning away. From the coldness inside. Just a world that we all must share. It's not enough just to stand and stare. Is it only a dream that there'll be. No more turning away?'"
