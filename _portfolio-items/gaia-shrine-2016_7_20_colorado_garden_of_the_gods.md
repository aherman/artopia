Expecting some challenging hiking options while here I was a little disappointed, but realized that I just needed to change my expectations of this place. In this regard it is accurately named a "garden". The majestic rocky outcrops and joy I observed others of all backgrounds and abilities having more than made up for my skewed personal expectations. "Garden of the Gods" is quite aptly named.
