title: What is a Hippie Futurist?
author:
date: 2015-07-28
text: My ideal view of the future is one in which humanity reconnects with nature, our one globally shared home. We will apply technology with a humanist approach, rather than a commercial one. Rather than driving people apart, technology will do the heavy lifting and allow humans to do what they do best- exist as social creatures.
