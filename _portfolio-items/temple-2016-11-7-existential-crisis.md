All feelings derive from judgment (e.g. that an event or the self is good or bad) and are therefore caused by having certain philosophical beliefs about what makes something good or bad.
Existential crisis happens when one starts questioning their fundamental beliefs. It is only uncomfortable when it causes emotional response. This happens because you are still holding onto some beliefs! You are not free until you work through and restructure your belief system.
