Do not be afraid of sociopaths, thieves, rapists, and terrorists. You should fear the greedy corporations, unjust laws, corrupt institutions, and systemic flaws in the socioeconomic system that create the conditions that drive people to that behavior. Under the right conditions everyone is capable of those acts, including you. Human nature does not describe what is inevitable, it describes what is possible in an bad environment.
