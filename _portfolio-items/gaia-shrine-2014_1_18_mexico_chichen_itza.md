I experienced the Chichen Itza complex on a group tour, where we learned about insights of its past based on archaeological discoveries and theories. The presence felt much more profound than the straightforward stories of kingdoms and religion and sacrifice. I often wonder how much we really know about these ancient civilizations.. how much of our "knowledge" is just projection of our current culture, beliefs, values, and understandings of how the universe works? This place is definitely worth a visit to spark the questioning and reverence.
