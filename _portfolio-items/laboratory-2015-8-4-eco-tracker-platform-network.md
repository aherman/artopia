text: I propose an online tool/platform that quantifies your past and current impact and allows you to track your impact over time. As you make positive lifestyle and habit changes, you can track the concrete improvements in emission reductions and money saved. This tool can be used by individuals, families, and even larger groups like neighborhoods and corporations. This networked approach is a great opportunity for gamification and competition between individuals and teams to improve their lifestyles.
