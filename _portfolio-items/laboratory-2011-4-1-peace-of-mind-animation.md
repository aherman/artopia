text: This is part of an extracurricular school project in 2011 to develop animation skills using Adobe Flash. The subject is the Boston song “Peace of Mind.” I only completed animation of the first verse because I encountered audio syncing issues as the animation went on (probably due to my slow computer). I have the remaining verses story-boarded and hope to complete animation for the full song someday.
